#ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

This analysis was performed on a time series dataset of daily profits generated by a fictional telecommunications company. It demonstrates the entire process of data cleaning, evaluation, and model selection for the generation of an ARIMA forecasting model for the purposes of projecting future values of daily profits. All research questions, hypotheses, inferences, and conclusions contained in this analysis are my own unless otherwise cited.

This analysis does not contain a video presentation. However, a more detailed and in-depth analysis performed using the greater SARIMAX architecture can be found in my final capstone analysis: [Capstone: AQI Time Series Analysis](LINK).

The included Jupyter notebook file contains all of the code and associated reporting of this analysis, and can be accessed by clicking on the file in the window above. Alternatively, an html export of the executed notebook can also be accessed.
