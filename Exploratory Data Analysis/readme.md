# Exploratory Data Analysis

This analysis demonstrates the univariate, bivariate, and statistical testing of features (in this instance, t-testing), in order to answer a research question relevant to the identified business needs of a fictional telecommunications company. All research questions, hypotheses, inferences, and conclusions contained in this analysis are my own unless otherwise cited.

This analysis was quite short, so the code was presented in a simple python script file, while a complete written report was generated via the docx file contained above. The video presentation can be found at the following link:
