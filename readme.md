##Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository serves as a collection of various data analyses that I have performed throughout my journey to obtain my Master of Science in Data Analytics degree from Western Governors University. I think the diversity of tasks and skillsets demonstrated through these projects highlight my range and utility as an analyst. Most of these analyses include complete video presentations, demonstrations of code functionality, and detailed explanations of the methodologies utilized.

Due to the number of projects and files contained in this repository, I would encourage anyone interested in a holistic example of what I offer to begin with the [Stakeholder Video Presentation](LINK) contained in my Representation, Reporting and Advanced Data Acquisition subdirectory. This presentation demonstrates a complete end-to-end analysis designed and executed by myself, executed in both Python and SQL, and visualized using Tableau. The presentation is delivered "in character" using a Powerpoint presentation to a varied audience of organizational stakeholders in a fictional telecommunications company. This analysis was recognized with an Excellence Award from WGU, which I have included in the subdirectory.

For convenience, all subdirectories in this repository will be linked below for ease of exploration. Following these links will also open a convenient "README" file containing a short summary of the analysis performed as well as instructions for accessing relevant files.
