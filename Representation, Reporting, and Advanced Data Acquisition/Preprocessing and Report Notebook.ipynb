Regardless of parameter settings, the left half of the dashboard represents data that is purely confined to the Churn dataset. When the Customer Data Parameter drop down is set to “Charts,”  the top left quadrant contains a stacked bar chart visualizing the percentages of customers who do or do not subscribe to the organization’s broadband internet services. The customer base is divided into 3 bars representing income brackets in this visualization. The bottom left quadrant contains a pie chart that represents the percentage of customers who own or do not own a tablet device. When the “Customer Parameter” drop down control is changed from “Charts” to “Maps,” these two visualizations are replaced with other visualizations. In the top left quadrant, the alternate visualization is a map with data points corresponding to generated geolocational data corresponding with each customer’s zip code. Each data point is color coded to represent the income bracket of the customer that it corresponds to. In the bottom left quadrant, the pie chart is replaced by a map of the United States with each state shaded differently. The intensity of the shading corresponds to the percentage of total customers in that state who own a tablet device.\n",

    "The variables extracted from the Census dataset are critical in contextualizing the customer data contained in the Churn dataset. It is relatively simple to evaluate our customer base across different services, and even further break those percentages down across different demographic features, but the resulting figures are meaningless without any context of where they should or should not fall. Having the ability to make direct comparisons between a customer base and the greater American population gives executive leadership insight into how well or poorly the organization is doing along that service axis. As a telecom company, our broadband service numbers should logically be higher than the national average, as our customers are ostensibly seeking out our services for the sole purpose of meeting those needs. With regards to tablet ownership, a lower percentage of customers who own tablets relative to the national average might indicate a marketing opportunity for device sales or inclusion of financed tablet devices as a means to drive traffic to customers signing one-year or two-year service contracts, thereby maximizing their tenure."

While the percentage difference tables outline the explicit need for action, the map features allow executives to begin strategizing localized efforts to cater to the identified segments of the customer base. This ultimately assists leadership in rectifying the discrepancies between our customer base and the national averages while also driving further targeted data collection in order to better understand the factors underpinning regional deviations.

    "\n",
    "The dashboard has been built as simply as possible, with no tabs to navigate and minimal interactive controls, in order for executive leadership to quickly and effectively absorb the story of our two selected service metrics. With regards to the presentation itself, multiple talking points were chosen to speak directly to the interests of specific audience members. Those talking points will be outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Senior Vice President for Customer Experience (SVP) is, according to the provided data dictionary, primarily focused on customer engagement and retention, and is principally focused on key characteristics of given customer groups which might drive behavior. In the presentation, I tried to speak directly to the SVP in my recommendations for incentivized customer data collection in the form of surveying to understand the behavioral patterns that underpin the discrepancies between our numbers and the national averages across both metrics. I also had the SVP in mind when recommending focused, granular analyses of that survey data against customer demographic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Executive Vice President of Sales (EVP) has a slightly different role, being tasked with recruitment, retention, renewal sales, and planning the development of promotions and products to reach broad categories of customers. The EVP was who I specifically had in mind when choosing and exploring my two metrics. For broadband service across income levels, I spoke in the presentation to the specific income groups that we appear to be missing in our delivery of those services, how that might also translate to potential new customers within those income levels. The inclusion of a symbol map of customers’ income levels also spoke to the EVP’s interest in regional demographic breakdowns. In our metric of tablet ownership, I appealed to the EVP by proposing the inclusion of discounted or financed tablet devices as potential customer incentives in service contracts, maximizing retention and creating targeted service upselling opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Panel of Regional Vice Presidents (Regional VP) are chiefly concerned with actionable insights that will drive their own regional policies, initiatives, and operational goals. The regional concentrations of income brackets in the symbol map and the map of tablet ownership by state gives regional VP’s an immediate indication as to the priority of developing regionally appropriate initiatives relative to these metrics within their own sectors. For example, the Regional VP of a region with lower concentrations of middle income and high income customers might first choose to focus on operational strategies related to tablet ownership if the states in their region demonstrate low percentages in that metric. In effect, the maps allow them an immediate point of comparison to other regions and illustrate how affected their region with reference to these metrics. Within the presentation, the included explanation of how to read and interact with the maps was primarily included for the benefit of Regional VP’s exploring these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My peers on the Data Analytics team will be primarily focused on the underlying story and mechanics of this analysis can be leveraged in further research in order to expand upon the insights offered. In my presentation, I specifically targeted my teammates by detailing what doors the primary metrics derived from this analysis (namely, the relative differences between our own numbers and national averages) open with regards to further research and analysis. I specifically outlined several analyses that could immediately be planned in order to generate a more granular understanding of how our two metrics impact different regions and demographics. The data-driven story told in this analysis is short and fairly straightforward to summarize: Middle income and high income households are not purchasing broadband services from us at levels we would expect, and our customer base has a conspicuously low rate of tablet ownership. These are clear insights, but without further analysis as to their underlying correlations with other features, any actions taken to rectify them will be largely undertaken with a certain degree of contextual blindness. Outlining the next steps for my peers enables this analysis to contribute to a much larger and more comprehensive data-driven story related to these metrics."

    "\n",
    "Establishing a contextual understanding of the datasets used in this analysis is critical in communicating what the figures and measures presented actually mean. Explaining the features our internal dataset is fairly straightforward, but since the income columns and Internet Service columns in particular were processed to make them correspond more directly to the features contained in the Census dataset, explaining that process early in the presentation was very important in justifying the comparisons made between our customer base and national averages. With respect to the census data itself, I provided a brief explanation of how I generated the dummy dataset so that it would be directly comparable to our own internal data. These explanations were delivered as simply as possible in order to maintain the pace of the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actionable insights were more difficult to organize for the benefit of the different sections of my audience. Instead of dividing those insights into sections relevant to each audience portion, I instead tried to seed them evenly between my explanations of each metric in an attempt to seed the information and insight most relevant to each audience portion as close to equidistant as possible throughout the presentation. The goal of structuring the presentation this way was to prioritize sustained engagement of each individual portion of the audience, and give as few opportunities as possible for different audience portions to become distracted."
