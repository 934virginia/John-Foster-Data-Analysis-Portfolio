#Representation, Reporting, and Advanced Data Acquisition

This analysis incorporated a self-selected external dataset into our existing fictional telecommunications dataset in order to generate performance metrics and KPI's relevant to the needs of our fictional telecom organization. My work on this project earned an Excellence Award in Advanced Data Acquisition from Western Governor's University, which has been included in this subdirectory.

These projects span the content of multiple courses, but due to the structuring of the underlying research questions, can be more easily conceptualized as a demonstration of multiple approaches to performing the same analysis. The data processing is demonstrated both through Python scripting in the "Preprocessing and Report Notebook" .ipynb file, and in the "Advanced SQL Query" .sql file. Both approaches accomplish the same thing in their respective languages and exist to prepare the data for use in constructing the final Tableau Dashboard, which can be found and explored freely [AT THIS LINK](LINK). 

Note that minor differences in data sourcing between these courses result in differences in their respective video presentations. However, I recommend that you simply watch the "Stakeholder Presentation" video for a comprehensive understanding of this analysis. This presentation is delivered "in character" to a number of organizational shareholders and demonstrates the functionality of the complete Tableau dashboard.
