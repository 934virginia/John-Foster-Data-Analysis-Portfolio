# Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

This analysis demonstrates the construction and performance of hierarchical clustering utilizing an agglomerative clustering model to answer a research question relevant to the identified business needs of a fictional telecommunications company. This analysis could best be described as a study of behavioral segmentation in a customer base. All research questions, hypotheses, inferences, and conclusions contained in this analysis are my own unless otherwise cited.
