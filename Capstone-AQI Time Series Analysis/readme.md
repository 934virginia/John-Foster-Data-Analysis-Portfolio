# Capstone Project: AQI Time Series Analysis

This analysis was an entirely self-designed final project for my MSDA incorporating various skillsets relevant to my graduate studies. The analysis utilized Air Quality Index datasets sourced from the EPA and performed an extensive time series analysis for the purposes of constructing a forecasting model that could accurately predict the Daily AQI of Seattle, Washington. All research questions, hypotheses, inferences, and conclusions contained in this analysis are my own unless otherwise cited.

The included Jupyter notebook file contains all of the code and associated reporting of this analysis, and can be accessed by clicking on the file in the window above. Alternatively, an html export of the executed notebook can also be accessed. A condensed Executive Summary of the project is included in pdf form.
